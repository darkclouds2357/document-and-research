When writing and designing a document for the system using the C4 model, each context should be given a clear and descriptive title that reflects the level of detail being covered. Hereâ€™s how you can name the titles for each context:

# 1. Context Level
## Title: System Context Diagram
### Alternative Titles:
- "High-Level System Overview"  
- "System Interaction Diagram"  
Purpose: To provide a broad overview of the system, its external interactions, and its role within the broader environment.  
# 2. Container Level
## Title: Container Diagram
### Alternative Titles:
- "System Architecture Overview"  
- "High-Level Component Structure"  
Purpose: To illustrate the main components (containers) within the system, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other.  
# 3. Component Level
## Title: Component Diagram
### Alternative Titles:
- "Detailed Component Structure"  
- "Internal Component Architecture"  
Purpose: To provide a more detailed view of the internal structure of each container, showing the specific components and how they collaborate.  
# 4. Code Level
## Title: Code Structure and Design  
### Alternative Titles: 
- "Implementation Details"  
- "Code-Level Architecture"  
Purpose: To delve into the actual code structure, including class diagrams, code snippets, and detailed explanations of the implementation.  

# Summary of Naming Titles:
- System Context Diagram (Context Level)
- Container Diagram (Container Level)
- Component Diagram (Component Level)
- Code Structure and Design (Code Level)
These titles help organize the document logically, making it easier for readers to navigate through different levels of detail in the system's architecture.
