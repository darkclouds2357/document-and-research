The C4 model is a framework for visualizing the architecture of software systems, created by Simon Brown. It provides a structured way to document software architecture at different levels of detail, making it easier to communicate with various stakeholders. The C4 model is composed of four levels, each focusing on a different aspect of the system:

## Context Diagram (Level 1):

Purpose: Provides a high-level overview of the system and its external interactions.
Audience: Non-technical stakeholders such as business users, managers, and customers.
Content: Shows the system as a "black box" and identifies external users (actors) and other systems that interact with it.

## Container Diagram (Level 2):

Purpose: Zooms into the system to show its high-level technical structure, including applications, databases, and other infrastructure components.
Audience: Technical stakeholders, including architects, developers, and operations teams.
Content: Illustrates how the system is decomposed into containers such as web applications, mobile apps, microservices, databases, etc., and how these containers communicate with each other.

## Component Diagram (Level 3):

Purpose: Breaks down each container into its individual components, showing their internal structure and interactions.
Audience: Developers and technical team members who need to understand the system's implementation details.
Content: Focuses on components within a container, such as classes, modules, services, and how they interact through interfaces or APIs.
## Code (Level 4):

Purpose: Provides detailed diagrams or descriptions of the code-level structures, such as classes, interfaces, methods, etc.
Audience: Developers working directly on the code.
Content: This level is optional and usually includes class diagrams or sequence diagrams for critical code.
These levels provide a clear, scalable way to describe and document software architecture, helping to ensure that the right amount of detail is presented to the appropriate audience. The goal of the C4 model is to make architecture descriptions more accessible and understandable, bridging the gap between high-level design and code-level details.
